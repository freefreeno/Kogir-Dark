## Kogir GTK

GTK theme to match the popular Qogir KDE Plasma theme made in KDE for KDE not Gnome

Seems to work better in KDE for  me than trying to use the regular GTK theme.
In KDE I see no need in installing Gnome themes when you can use the KDE gtk and seems to work better in KDE than normal gtk for me any ways.

## You can find the Qogir KDE theme here:
